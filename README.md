# 📱 Mental Health Support for Students  
**Hackathon Track: Student Lifestyle**  

## 🧩 Problem Statement  
University students today face increasing mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, and stress. These are often brought on by financial pressures, heavy academic workloads, and the fast pace of campus life.  

Despite the prevalence of these issues, many students do not seek help. Common barriers include:  
- Limited access to counseling resources  
- Fear of stigma  
- Lack of convenient, accessible support tools  

## 🎯 Our Solution  
We designed a **mobile application prototype** that complements existing student support systems by providing proactive, stigma-free mental health tools.  

### Goals of the Solution:  
- Help students **track and reflect** on their moods and emotions  
- Encourage **self-care practices** in daily campus life  
- Provide **easy access to resources** such as counseling and peer support groups  
- Create a tool that is **inclusive, user-friendly, and accessible** to all students  

## ✨ Features (Prototype)  
- 📊 **Mood Diary** – record daily emotional check-ins with easy-to-use emoji/mood scales  
- 💬 **Peer Chat** – safe spaces for students to connect, share, and support one another  
- 🗓️ **Appointment Booking** – book counseling sessions directly through the app  
- 📍 **Campus Integration** – reminders, maps, and event notifications  
- 🧠 **Wellness Tests** – quick self-assessments to provide feedback and recommendations
